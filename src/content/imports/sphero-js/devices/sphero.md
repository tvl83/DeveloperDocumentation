commanding a new reference heading (in degrees).

If stabilization is enabled, Sphero will respond immediately to this.

**Params:**

- `heading` (Number) Sphero's new reference heading, in degrees (0-359)
- `callback` (Function) function to be triggered after writing

### setStabilization(flag, callback)

```
orb.setStabilization(1, function(err, data) {
  console.log(err || "data: " + data);
});
```

The Set Stabilization command turns Sphero's internal stabilization on or
off, depending on the flag provided.

**Params:**

- `flag` (Number) stabilization setting flag (0 - off, 1 - on)
- `callback` (Function) function to be triggered after writing

### setRotationRate(rotation, callback)

The Set Rotation Rate command allows control of the rotation rate Sphero
uses to meet new heading commands.

A lower value offers better control, but with a larger turning radius.

Higher values yield quick turns, but Sphero may lose control.

The provided value is in units of 0.784 degrees/sec.

**Params:**

- `rotation` (Number) new rotation rate (0-255)
- `callback` (Function) function to be triggered after writing

### getChassisId(callback)

```
orb.getChassisId(function(err, data) {

  y (front, back) axes of Sphero. 0x00 disables the contribution of that
  axis.
- **xs, ys** - 8-bit settable speed value for X/Y axes. This setting is
  ranged by the speed, than added to `xt` and `yt` to generate the final
  threshold value.
- **dead** - an 8-bit post-collision dead time to prevent re-triggering.
  Specified in 10ms increments.

**Params:**

- `opts` (Object) object containing collision configuration opts
- `cb` (Function) function to be triggered after writing

    console.log("  yvel:", data.yvel);
    console.log("  sog:", data.sog);
  }
});
```

The Read Locator command gets Sphero's current position (X,Y), component
velocities, and speed-over-ground (SOG).

  console.log(err || "data: " + data);
});
```

The Set Raw Motors command allows manual control over one or both of
Sphero's motor output values.

Each motor (left and right requires a mode and a power value from 0-255.

This command will disable stabilization is both mode's aren't "ignore", so
you'll need to re-enable it once you're done.

Possible modes:

- `0x00`: Off (motor is open circuit)

The Run Macro command attempts to execute the specified macro.

Macro IDs are split into groups:

0-31 are System Macros. They are compiled into the Main Application, and
cannot be deleted. They are always available to run.

32-253 are User Macros. They are downloaded and persistently stored, and
can be deleted in total.

255 is the Temporary Macro, a special user macro as it is held in RAM for
execution.

254 is also a special user macro, called the Stream Macro that doesn't
require this call to begin execution.

This command will fail if there is a currently executing macro, or the
specified ID code can't be found.

**Params:**

    console.log("  id:", data.id);
    console.log("  cmdNum:", data.cmdNum);
  }
});
```

The Abort Macro command aborts any executing macro, and returns both it's
ID code and the command number currently in progress.

An exception is a System Macro executing with the UNKILLABLE flag set.

A returned ID code of 0x00 indicates that no macro was running, an ID code
of 0xFFFF as the CmdNum indicates the macro was unkillable.

**Params:**

- `callback` (Function) function to be triggered with response

### getMacroStatus(callback)

    console.log("data:");
    console.log("  idCode:", data.idCode);
    console.log("  cmdNum:", data.cmdNum);
  }
});
```

The Get Macro Status command returns the ID code and command number of the
currently executing macro.

If no macro is running, the 0x00 is returned for the ID code, and the
command number is left over from the previous macro.

**Params:**

- `callback` (Function) function to be triggered with response

### setMacroParam(index, val1, val2, callback)

```
orb.setMacroParam(0x02, 0xF0, 0x00, function(err, data) {

The Set Macro Parameter command allows system globals that influence
certain macro commands to be selectively altered from outside of the macro
system itself.

The values of Val1 and Val2 depend on the parameter index.

Possible indices:

- **00h** Assign System Delay 1: Val1 = MSB, Val2 = LSB
- **01h** Assign System Delay 2: Val1 = MSB, Val2 = LSB
- **02h** Assign System Speed 1: Val1 = speed, Val2 = 0 (ignored)
- **03h** Assign System Speed 2: Val1 = speed, Val2 = 0 (ignored)
- **04h** Assign System Loops: Val1 = loop count, Val2 = 0 (ignored)

For more details, please refer to the Sphero Macro document.

**Params:**

- `index` (Number) what parameter index to use
- `val1` (Number) value 1 to set

### appendMacroChunk(chunk, callback)

```
orb.appendMacroChunk(, function(err, data) {
  console.log(err || "data: " + data);
});
```

The Append Macro Chunk project stores the attached macro definition into
the temporary RAM buffer for later execution.

It's similar to the Save Temporary Macro command, but allows building up
longer temporary macros.

Any existing Macro ID can be sent through this command, and executed
through the Run Macro call using ID 0xFF.

If this command is sent while a Temporary or Stream Macro is executing it
will be terminated so that its storage space can be overwritten. As with
all macros, the longest chunk that can be sent is 254 bytes.

You must follow this with a Run Macro command (ID 0xFF) to actually get it
to go and it is best to prefix this command with an Abort call to make
certain the larger buffer is completely initialized.

**Params:**

- `chunk` (Array) of bytes to append for macro execution
